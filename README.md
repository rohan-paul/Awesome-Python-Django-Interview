# Awesome Python Interviews

A collection of super-popular Interview questions, along with answers, and some code-snippets that I was putting together for myself while preparing for Python interviews. Many of these questions are taken from real interview. It is by no means comprehensive, and the answers are relatively short ( and for each of the concepts, there are probably better and/or more in depth coverage in the web), but I see this repo as reference tool, so I can continue a technical talk with the interviewer for two to three hours.
